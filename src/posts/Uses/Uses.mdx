Make sure to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) for a list of everyone's /uses pages!


Everyday I get a few emails asking about the specifics of some piece of software or hardware I use.

I change up things fairly often, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

If there is something missing shoot me a tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos">@wesbos</a> and I'll add it.

Most of these links are amazon affiliate links, so I'll get philthy rich if you click them and buy something.

### Editor + Terminal

* <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is my current editor which I switched to in September 2017 after years of Sublime Text.
* <a href="http://SublimeText.com/3dev">Sublime Text</a> V3 beta is used in most of my video tutorials â€” I write more about my setup in <a href="http://SublimeTextBook.com">my book</a>.
* I created a theme called Cobalt2 for <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2">VS Code</a>, <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Cobalt2">Sublime Text</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm">iTerm2</a> v3 which I use.

* I'm currently using <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/">Operator Mono</a> for a font. Yes I paid the $200 for it. Yes I actually like it. Before that I used <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a> for many years.

* Firefox Developer has been my main browser since January 2020. We did a <a href="https://syntax.fm/show/213/hasty-treat-a-month-on-firefox">show on it here</a>

* The cursive font you see is just the italic weight of Operator Mono. Your theme must have italics in it for it to work - my Cobalt2 uses italics heavily.
* I currently use <a href="https://hyper.is/">Hyper</a> for my terminal, but many of my videos show me using iTerm2.

* For Sublime Text, The JavaScript suggestions you see in my videos is called <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JavaScript%20Completions">JavaScript Completions</a> - you might have to play with the settings to get it to not popup some of the node completions. For VS Code, there are no plugins needed to get this.

* You can see most of my config files (.eslint, VS Code settings) over at my <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/dotfiles">Dot Files repo</a> but please don't just take these settings carte blanche - they work for me but might not be the best


### Desktop Apps
* I use <a href="https://folivora.ai/">Better Touch Tool</a> for window management, custom keyboard shortcuts (via the Hyper key) and a few other things. Best mac software ever!
* I use <a href="https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander">Text Expander</a> for canned responses and for most of my code snippets
* I'm a huge <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> fan and have many <a href="http://wes.io/fY7q">workflows</a>.
* I use <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things App</a> with a <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD mindset</a> for managing my tasks.
* I design almost entirely in <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>
* The cool Emoji picker you see me use in my videos is <a href="http://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/">Rocket</a>

### Backup Strategy
My Backup strategy is as follows:

* I backup my entire computer locally to a Time Machine on a [LaCie rugged](https://amzn.to/3ti4IMp) portable hard drive
* I backup my entire computer remotely to <a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/008x60">BackBlaze</a>
* I still use <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> quite a bit, but it's a huge resource hog.
* I run a <a href="https://amzn.to/3cvGMzf">Synology NAS DS920+</a> with 4 <a href="https://amzn.to/36S8lzh">4TB Seagate Ironwolf HDD</a>

### Recording
* I use <a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/">ScreenFlow</a> to record and edit my screencasts
* My mic is a <a href="https://amzn.to/36AOpR2">Heil PR40</a> with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011SRQ24G/">BSW RE27POP Pop Filter</a> on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SZVZ74/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000SZVZ74&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=HJ6K3KRLOL5XJJSC">PL2T boom arm</a>. Many of my earlier videos were recorded on the cheaper but still amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H92QK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0006H92QK&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=PHY64E6Y43GHI55T">AT2020</a>

* I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LWH79A/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004LWH79A&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=E3KFCLCQIXXLC7W4">DBX286s</a> to do all my audio compression and processing as I record and pipe it into my computer with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OZE9SA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005OZE9SA&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=ELZASVHMTR6ZTNYL">Focusrite 2i2</a>.

## Cameras and Lighting
* My webcam is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JH8T3S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=webo080-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B006JH8T3S&linkId=65a64ee5dd16f2fa18faf2f2d33d0538">Logitech HD Pro c920</a>
* I run a <a href="https://amzn.to/36wUePu">Sony RX100 III</a> with the HDMI out plugged into an <a href="https://amzn.to/3avQNts">Elgato CamLink</a>. I also have a cheaper <a href="https://amzn.to/36B6rmj">knockoff camlink</a> that works pretty well.
* Above my desk I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/3czWWHR">Neewer 480 LED</a> light that has seperate warm and cool light knobs. I bounce the light off the angled ceiling and it lights my face pretty well.
* I run [RGB Floodlights](https://amzn.to/3oGJPXG) for backfill lights. Still tweaking the colours of these to not look like a gamer.

### Desk Setup

* My main monitor is a 32" 4k <a href="https://amzn.to/2SYuX8G">LG 32ud59</a>. I usually run this at 1440 or 1692. Best developer monitor bang for your buck hands down.
* To my right I run a vertical 27" 4k <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PC9HFO8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00PC9HFO8&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=5VCVP6ZUPF5GLCUJ">Dell 4k P2715Q</a> and an open loaded macbook pro nested on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OOYECC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000OOYECC&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=XWDACWNC2JWRF3DQ">Rain mStand</a>
* I sit on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LTAO8S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000LTAO8S&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=6G4M6ZR4CYKT3TM5">polished aluminum Herman Miller aeron</a>
* I swapped out the wheels for [ROLLER BLADE WHEELS](https://amzn.to/35zIwUF). Best upgrade ever, highly recommend these. If you have an ikea chair, get the 10mm ones, otherwise 11mm.
* My desk is an <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/karlby-countertop-oak-veneer-70335207/">8 foot oak butcher block countertop</a> on legs. Mine is solid oak, but it looks like they aren't currently selling a solid version. Most flooring and home improvement stores will sell butcher block.
* Here is a <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1060643936140738560">photo of my setup</a>
* Everything â€” Monitors, Ethernet, Hard Drives, Webcam, and Power â€” is plugged in via a single USB cable and piped into my <a href="https://amzn.to/2D9Jnx0">Caldigit TS3 Plus</a> - This is a pretty sweet setup!
* All this gear is pretty demanding, so I use an <a href="http://amzn.to/2kVaDCz">Amazon Basics 10 Port USB Hub</a> to make it all work at once while only having to plug in a single cable into the above dock.

* I currently use a 2019 16" MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 with 32gb memory
* My last laptop was a 2017 15" MacBook Pro 3.1GHz i7 with 16gb memory
* The keyboard is an Apple keyboard with a number pad. It's space grey so lots of people think it's some wicked hacker keyboard. I've tried a few mechanical keyboards but they are all too loud for my recording :)
* Mouse is a Logitech MX2 Master

<h3>Other Gear</h3>

* After a lengthy search for the perfect backpack for both traveling and schlepping gear around the city I bought the <a href="http://amzn.to/2kHB4kc">Peak Design Everyday Backpack 30L</a> and it's incredible (and very expensive ðŸ˜‘).
* I listen to Bose QC35 headphones all day at my desk and AirPods Pro when on the go
